Partial Differential Equations

CAVEAT
------
FISHPACK90 1.1 is written in Fortran 77 and 90 but it does not fully comply 
with either Fortran standard. It breaks the standard by calling routines with 
one type of argument and later uses the argument as another type.  There may 
be other violations as well. Users whose applications require strict adherence 
to the standard should not use FISHPACK90 1.1.

Documentation
-------------
Documentation for this software package is provided in file FISHPACK90_1.1.html
and companion image file FISH90.gif.  We intend the document for browsing on your 
local computer.

Recent bugfixes
---------------
None. This library is regarded as legacy; users have reported no problems other 
than standards violations, for several years.  These will not be fixed.

Compiling the Library and Test Programs
---------------------------------------
Our Makefile requires the following: a Unix or Linux or Mac operating system, gmake, 
and a Fortran 90 compiler to make the library and its test executables.  If successful, 
this Makefile builds a static library libfishpack90.a and several binary executables.

Examine file make.inc to see if your OS and compiler are represented.  If they 
are not, you should modify file make.inc and the Makefile in each directory 
(main, src and test) so that they are represented.

If you desire double precision floating-point arithmetic, you should modify Makefile 
and make.inc with compiler options for promoting single to double precision.  Your 
compiler's user guide will have information on the required compiler options.
